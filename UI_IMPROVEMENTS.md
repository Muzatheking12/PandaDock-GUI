## Specific Bug Fixes

### Layout Issues Resolved
1. **Button Overlapping**: Fixed overlapping button containers by:
   - Removing redundant button creation code that caused duplicate labels
   - Increasing dock widget height from 450px to 550px for 6 buttons
   - Optimizing spacing and margins (4px spacing, 8px margins)
   - Reducing button height to 38px for better fit
   - Minimizing container padding (6px instead of 10px)
2. **Button Text Visibility**: Fixed white text on light background issue using multiple approaches:
   - **Global CSS Approach**: Added `!important` declarations and multiple specificity levels
   - **Individual Button Stylesheets** (Final Solution): Applied Copilot's suggestion
     * Created `self.enabled_button_style` and `self.disabled_button_style` as instance variables
     * Applied individual `.setStyleSheet()` to each button for direct control
     * Dynamic style switching when buttons are enabled/disabled throughout workflow
     * Professional color scheme with perfect contrast ratios
     * No CSS inheritance conflicts or specificity issues
3. **Container Sizing**: Added minimum width constraints to prevent layout collapse
4. **Spacing Consistency**: Implemented optimized spacing between components
5. **Layout Margins**: Added proper margins around the button panel

### New Features Added

   - Loads molecular structure files directly into PyMOL
   - Shows text files in built-in viewer
2. **File Viewer Dialog**: Simple viewer for log files and text output
3. **Progressive UI Enablement**: Buttons enable in logical workflow sequence

### Button Functionality Issues Resolved
1. **Dialog Function Accessibility**: Fixed incorrectly placed function definitions
   - Moved `dialogxfrom()` and `dialogxdock()` from inside classes to module level
   - Fixed global function access issues
   - Proper function accessibility from button handlers
2. **Workflow Sequence**: Complete button enabling/disabling logic
